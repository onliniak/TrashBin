TODO: Write a description here

It all started when I found free ($0.00) shared hosting with SSH access. 
The only problem was FreeBSD 11 instead of Linux (this is why I use Crystal 0.27).

Since I've been thinking about my first OOP MVC(?) application for three months, 
I decided to write two libraries (IndieAuth and Micropub) and ÂµPub which uses them.
